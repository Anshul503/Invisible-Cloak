# Invisible-Cloak
This project can only be possible in virtuality not in reality.             Here first it capture the background image for first 5 seconds and then I have given red color for the invisible cloth such that after first 5 seconds whenever red color comes in front of screen, it replaces that red color  co-ordinate with the background image co-ordinate for that position and the image disappear(which is in red).    This technique was also used in "Harry-Potter" and now it is widely used in animated movies, etc.
